    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol class="ordered">
      
      <li class="instructions">Preheat the barbecue chargrill and hot plate on medium heat.</li>

      <li class="instructions">In a medium bowl, whisk the tomato sauce, vinegar, sugar, hot sauce, Worcestershire, 1 tsp sea salt flakes and ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper. Reserve 1/3 cup (80ml) of the sauce for basting and set the remaining sauce aside.</li>

      <li class="instructions">Brush the chicken with 2 teaspoons of oil and season with salt and pepper. Barbecue the chicken on the chargrill, basting with the reserved barbecue sauce, for 6 mins or until charred. Turn the chicken over and cook, basting the chicken with more barbecue sauce, for 6 mins or until the chicken is cooked through but still juicy. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board to rest for 5 mins. Dice the chicken into 1cm pieces and transfer to a large bowl. Add ½ cup (125ml) of the remaining barbecue sauce and toss to coat. Season the chicken mixture to taste with salt and pepper.</li>

      <li class="instructions">Meanwhile, brush the onion with 2 teaspoons of oil and season with salt. Cook on the chargrill, turning as needed, for 12 mins or until charred and tender.</li>

      <li class="instructions">Brush one side of the tortillas with 2 teaspoons of oil. Lay the tortillas, oiled-side down, on a work surface. Sprinkle ¼ cup of cheese over the bottom half of each tortilla and top with the charred onions. Divide the chicken mixture between the tortillas, then top with another ¼ cup of cheese. Top with the avocado slices and coriander. Fold the top half of the tortilla over the filling and press lightly to compact.</li>

      <li class="instructions">Lightly brush the remaining oil over the barbecue hot plate. Working in batches, place the quesadillas on the hot plate and cook, flipping halfway through cooking, for 5 mins or until the tortillas are golden brown and the cheese has melted. Transfer the quesadillas to a cutting board. Cut each quesadilla into 4 wedges and serve with the remaining barbecue sauce.</li>
